# MatrixMultiplicationRace
Implementing c++ Matrix multiplicator that runs faster then python numpy libraries implementation

speed is calculated with Flops
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_Point_Operations_Per_Second

python requires numpy library to run
https://numpy.org/install/

N by N matrix requires N*N*N*2 flops to multiply
